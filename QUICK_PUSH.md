# ⚡ Quick Push to GitHub

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `shiri-langer-portfolio`
3. **Description**: "Portfolio website for Shiri Langer - Industrial Designer"
4. **Visibility**: Public or Private
5. **Important**: 
   - ❌ DO NOT check "Add a README file"
   - ❌ DO NOT add .gitignore
   - ❌ DO NOT choose a license
   - (We already have all these files)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Code (After Creating Repo)

Once you create the repo, come back here and I'll push it for you!

Or run this command yourself:

```bash
cd /Users/YehonatanShapira/Documents/Coding/langer-shiri-clean
git push -u origin main
```

## ✅ Ready to Push!

The repository is already configured with:
- ✅ Remote: `https://github.com/shapidesign/shiri-langer-portfolio.git`
- ✅ Branch: `main`
- ✅ All files committed

Just create the repo on GitHub and tell me when it's ready!
